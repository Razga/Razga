### Hi thereðŸ‘‹, my web3 name is ZER8ðŸ§  and I'm full time in web3 since 2020. I'm currently a Gitcoin Steward, contributor to 1Hive and ODC volunteer

- ðŸ”­ I like:

- managing and creating grant programs using Gitcoins protocols
- helping people navigate and deeply understand web3 and the collaborative economy enabled by it
- defending public goods 
- being a public goods/regen ambassador 
- stewarding in Gitcoin DAO, Arbitrum DAO, Optimism, 1Hive and other value aligned organisations that I resonate with
- the regen movement and nature :D
- art of all forms

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to build the best Grant Review Dashboard in web3
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on cool stuff related to other cool stuff (lol)
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with learning data, programming, etc
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about grant programs, web3 trends and how to get you started in web3
- ðŸ“« You can DM me on Discord: ZER8ðŸ§ #9093
- âš¡ Fun fact: I was the Grant Eligibility team lead for Gitcoin for almost a year and a half. I lead the team and together we reviewed over 3000 grant applications
